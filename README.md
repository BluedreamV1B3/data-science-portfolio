# Jonathan's Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and R markdown files.

#### The R portfolio is located [Rhubs](https://rpubs.com/BlueDreamV1B3) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bluedreamv1b3/code)

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._


## Content

- ### Machine Learning

	- __Python__
                - [MRSA Classification]: Developed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) lesions from medical images, enhanced lesion identification by 70%, and minimized treatment delays by 90%
		- [Dog Breed Image Classification](https://github.com/BluedreamV1B3/CNN-Dog-Breed-Classification-): Classifying dog breeds given images using transfer learning and deploying the model using Streamlit. Includes different experiments, such as trying different data enhancement levels, replacing different top layers for the model, and unfreezing different base model layers.
  		- [LSTM and WaveNet for Music Generation](https://github.com/BluedreamV1B3/LSTM-and-WaveNet-for-Music-Generation): Building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network along with a scaled-down version of WaveNet for the purpose of music generation, aiming to gain experience in working with sequential models and data. 

     _Tools: scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, and Streamlit_

	- __R__
   		- [NBA 2023 Champion Prediction](https://rpubs.com/BlueDreamV1B3/NBA2023ChampionPrediction): Using Xgboost and Random Forest to predict the 2023 NBA championship team. Including web scraping, data cleaning, and building a machine-learning model pipeline.
 
- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- __Python__
  		- [Pennsylvania Deer Related Crashs Analysis](https://github.com/BluedreamV1B3/Pennsylvania-Deer-Related-Crashs-Analysis): Download data from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and analyze deer related crashes based on time, location, and other variables. Draw conclusions and recommendations from the data.
  		- [Brazilian E-Commerce EDA](https://github.com/BluedreamV1B3/Brazil-E-Commerce-EDA/tree/main): Exploratory Analysis of the Brazilian E-Commerce using visualisations techniques and graphical tools to create informative and easy-to-understand plots.

    _Tools: Pandas, Folium, Seaborn and Matplotlib_
